                    Hello! My name is Jacob Vanluven, but I go by KingToot (or other variations) online. The name originally came from an online 
                    flash game I used to play in Jr. High, and for some reason I stuck with it. I am an amateur
                    <span class="emphasize">Game Developer</span> and <span class="emphasize">Pixel Artist</span>, hoping to do something in game 
                    development, or even just general coding or art.
                </p>
                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things I love most is games. Some of my favorite individual games are: 
                    <a href="https://terraria.org">Terraria</a>, <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a>, 
                    <a href="https://www.hollowknight.com">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.celestegame.com">Celeste</a>, and  
                    <a href="https://unite.pokemon.com/en-us/">Pokemon Unite</a>. My favorite game series is The Legend of Zelda with my favorite 
                    entries being <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Phantom_Hourglass">Phantom Hourglass</a>, 
                    <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Spirit_Tracks">Spirit Tracks</a>, and 
                    <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Tears_Of_The_Kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. 
                    <br><br>
                    Another thing I'm really interested in is music. The main thing I listen to right now is EDM with my favorite producers being 
                    <a href="https://grabbitzmusic.com">Grabbitz</a>,
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/helloworldbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">helloworld</a>, and 
                    <a href="https://www.monstercat.com/artist/grant">Grant</a>. There is very little music I actually <span class="emphasize">
                    hate</span>, so other music I listen to can be varied. My favorite artists right now are 
                    <a href="https://www.ajrbrothers.com/#/">AJR</a>, <a href="http://www.jonbellion.com">Jon Bellion</a>, and

                    The last of my interest I will put here is my boyfriend :3 His name is Isaac and he is awesome! He loves history and is really 
                    funny and cute and sweet. He really enjoys history (as I said) and is thinking of majoring in it. He also loves cats (just 
                    like me) and one of my favorite places to go with him is the <a href="https://www.dexterscatcafe.com">Cat Cafe</a>! I feel like 
                    I could write a whole additional website just about him, so I will try to keep this short. Anyways, I love him a 
                    <span class="emphasize">LOT</span> and I am probably going to send him this when I'm finished soooooooooo hello :3

                <p>
                    I don't have a lot of games still up from my past work, but I have completed three "demo-like" games (At least in terms of 
                    content). I never really got them to a state I fully liked, but they were finished projects nonetheless. The only one that 
                    is still accessible (at least without a direct link) is one called "Blank is the Fake" and can by found on my
                    <a href="https://kingtoot.itch.io">Itch page</a>
                </p>
                <p><u>Here's a list of everything I've done:</u></p>

                    <u>Feed the Beast</u> - April 2020 | <a href="https://kingtoot.itch.io/feed-the-beast">Link</a>
                    <br><br>
                    Feed the Beast was my first released game, which was result of my first game jam: 
                    <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46">Ludum Dare 46</a>. It was a simple little puzzle game where you had to run 
                    across the dungeon floor, completing various minigames to gather and craft items to <span class="emphasize">feed</span> the 
                    <span class="emphasize">beast</span>. I made the logo (shown on the left) when I was still learning pixel art. It was 
                    <span class="emphasize">heavily</span> based on 
                    <a href="https://cdn2.steamgriddb.com/file/sgdb-cdn/grid/79f156e4132ca7f5856dfeb922a332dd.png">an old logo</a> 
                    from a group named <a href="https://www.feed-the-beast.com">Feed the Beast</a> (I know, very creative). I pulled a few 
                    all-nighters in the process of making this game, and I still have a lot of good memories from it. Right now, I'm a little 
                    embarrassed of it and I think that's because I have built a higher standard for myself. But regardless, it was a good starting 
                    point for me!

                    <u>Spiritual Connection</u> - Jan 2021 | <a href="https://kingtoot.itch.io/spiritual-connection">Link</a>
                    <br><br>
                    Spiritual Connection was the second game I released, and it was my entry for 
                    <a href="https://itch.io/jam/vimjam">Vimlark's VimJam</a> game jam. This game was pretty special to me because one of my best 
                    friends actually made some music for it (He's <a href="https://soundcloud.com/haha_you_found_me">Lenom</a> on SoundCloud)! 
                    It was a simple little platformer where you had to traverse through the level to a "portal", which would then swap some objects 
                    around. The main idea behind this game was based on the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/P_Switch">P-switch</a> from Super 
                    Mario. After reaching this portal, you would then have to go back through the level to the beginning with the new objects. I 
                    was only able to design 4 levels, and they are not balanced very well. However, it was still something I've completed and I think 
                    I improved a lot in art and desgin. But there is still a lot of work to do and improvements to make.

                    Blank is the Fake was the latest game I've released. I created it for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7">Brackeys 
                    Game Jam 2022.1</a>. This one was <span class="emphasize">by far</span> the least polished and fleshed-out. However, it still 
                    has a place in my heart. I made a lot of design choices that I really liked (for example, all the transitions were "smooth" 
                    with no "fade to black" transitions). It is a puzzle game based on a mixture of different puzzles found in my two favorite 
                    Legend of Zelda Games: <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Phantom_Hourglass">Phantom Hourglass</a> 
                    and <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Spirit_Tracks">Spirit Tracks</a>. The end product wasn't 
                    bad, and I did have plans to expand it past the jam's deadline. However, as it common with most of my projects, I quickly lost 
                    interest and moved on.

                <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
                It's honestly been a little hard for me to focus on game development recently. And I can't even blame it on school or friends or 
                really anything like that. I have plenty of time to work on it, especially late at night. However, I cannot seem to stay focused 
                on a single game for an extended period of time. The longest I've really worked on a game recently is like a week or so.
                <br><br>
                Besides game development, I do enjoy creating pixel art (See <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a>). I've always loved the look of 
                it, and I think I have gotten pretty decent. There are some pieces that I'm really proud of. And I think it's so interesting to 
                see where I've come from and where I am now. But that's besides the point. The main thing I want to talk about is what I've been 
                doing, and what I plan on doing in the future.
                <br><br>
                My main goal right now is to improve my skills with the <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot Game Engine</a>. 
                I have recently switched over from Unity, but I'm still learning the finer details of Godot as well as it's workflow. To do this, 
                I am planning on doing something called the <a href="https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io">20 Games Challenge</a>. 
                I already have a decent start with a Pong game, but I am <span class="emphasize">again</span> stuck in this loop where I work for 
                a good few days, then lose interest or motivation. However, I think I'm really going to start pushing myself to work on this. 
                I think if I can at least get through a few of these games, I can start to get used to finishing projects as well as learn Godot 
                to a much better degree than I do now.
                <h3>Game Launcher</h3>
                Other than that, there is not a whole lot in the works. One thing I really want to work on is creating a game launcher that will 
                download games from a GitHub repository that will automatically update when new versions are released. My plans right now are 
                heavily based on the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download">Minecraft Launcher</a>. I have created 
                a few version before this, and they worked pretty well, but they did not fully live up to my expectations. I think once I get a 
                good selection of games, I might take a break to build this launcher. This could also help with testing if I can find a few people 
                interested. Instead of sending them a link or file, I can just tell them to open the launcher and update the game. Idk how feasible 
                this all is, but it's something I'm pretty excited to start working on

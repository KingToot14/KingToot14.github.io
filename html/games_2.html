            <h2>What I've Worked On</h2>
            <p>
                I don't have a lot of games still up from my past work, but I have completed three "demo-like" games (At least in terms of 
                content). I never really got them to a state I fully liked, but they were finished projects nonetheless. The only one that 
                is still accessible (at least without a direct link) is one called "Blank is the Fake" and can by found on my

            <p><u>Here's a list of everything I've done:</u></p>
            <!-- Feed the Beast -->

                <u>Feed the Beast</u> - April 2020 | <a href="https://kingtoot.itch.io/feed-the-beast">Link</a>
                <br><br>
                Feed the Beast was my first released game, which was result of my first game jam: 
                <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46">Ludum Dare 46</a>. It was a simple little puzzle game where you had to run 
                across the dungeon floor, completing various minigames to gather and craft items to <span class="emphasize">feed</span> the 
                <span class="emphasize">beast</span>. I made the logo (shown on the left) when I was still learning pixel art. It was 
                <span class="emphasize">heavily</span> based on 
                <a href="https://cdn2.steamgriddb.com/file/sgdb-cdn/grid/79f156e4132ca7f5856dfeb922a332dd.png">an old logo</a> 
                from a group named <a href="https://www.feed-the-beast.com">Feed the Beast</a> (I know, very creative). I pulled a few 
                all-nighters in the process of making this game, and I still have a lot of good memories from it. Right now, I'm a little 
                embarrassed of it and I think that's because I have built a higher standard for myself. But regardless, it was a good starting 
                point for me!

                <u>Spiritual Connection</u> - Jan 2021 | <a href="https://kingtoot.itch.io/spiritual-connection">Link</a>
                <br><br>
                Spiritual Connection was the second game I released, and it was my entry for 
                <a href="https://itch.io/jam/vimjam">Vimlark's VimJam</a> game jam. This game was pretty special to me because one of my best 
                friends actually made some music for it (He's <a href="https://soundcloud.com/haha_you_found_me">Lenom</a> on SoundCloud)! 
                It was a simple little platformer where you had to traverse through the level to a "portal", which would then swap some objects 
                around. The main idea behind this game was based on the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/P_Switch">P-switch</a> from Super 
                Mario. After reaching this portal, you would then have to go back through the level to the beginning with the new objects. I 
                was only able to design 4 levels, and they are not balanced very well. However, it was still something I've completed and I think 
                I improved a lot in art and desgin. But there is still a lot of work to do and improvements to make.

                <br><br>
                Blank is the Fake was the latest game I've released. I created it for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7">Brackeys 
                Game Jam 2022.1</a>. This one was <span class="emphasize">by far</span> the least polished and fleshed-out. However, it still 
                has a place in my heart. I made a lot of design choices that I really liked (for example, all the transitions were "smooth" 
                with no "fade to black" transitions). It is a puzzle game based on a mixture of different puzzles found in my two favorite 
                Legend of Zelda Games: <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Phantom_Hourglass">Phantom Hourglass</a> 
                and <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Spirit_Tracks">Spirit Tracks</a>. The end product wasn't 
                bad, and I did have plans to expand it past the jam's deadline. However, as it common with most of my projects, I quickly lost 
                interest and moved on.

            <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
            It's honestly been a little hard for me to focus on game development recently. And I can't even blame it on school or friends or 
            really anything like that. I have plenty of time to work on it, especially late at night. However, I cannot seem to stay focused 
            on a single game for an extended period of time. The longest I've really worked on a game recently is like a week or so.
            <br><br>
            Besides game development, I do enjoy creating pixel art (See <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a>). I've always loved the look of 
            it, and I think I have gotten pretty decent. There are some pieces that I'm really proud of. And I think it's so interesting to 
            see where I've come from and where I am now. But that's besides the point. The main thing I want to talk about is what I've been 
            doing, and what I plan on doing in the future.
            <br><br>
            My main goal right now is to improve my skills with the <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot Game Engine</a>. 
            I have recently switched over from Unity, but I'm still learning the finer details of Godot as well as it's workflow. To do this, 
            I am planning on doing something called the <a href="https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io">20 Games Challenge</a>. 
            I already have a decent start with a Pong game, but I am <span class="emphasize">again</span> stuck in this loop where I work for 
            a good few days, then lose interest or motivation. However, I think I'm really going to start pushing myself to work on this. 
            I think if I can at least get through a few of these games, I can start to get used to finishing projects as well as learn Godot 
            to a much better degree than I do now.
            <h3>Game Launcher</h3>
            Other than that, there is not a whole lot in the works. One thing I really want to work on is creating a game launcher that will 
            download games from a GitHub repository that will automatically update when new versions are released. My plans right now are 
            heavily based on the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download">Minecraft Launcher</a>. I have created 
            a few version before this, and they worked pretty well, but they did not fully live up to my expectations. I think once I get a 
            good selection of games, I might take a break to build this launcher. This could also help with testing if I can find a few people 
            interested. Instead of sending them a link or file, I can just tell them to open the launcher and update the game. Idk how feasible 
            this all is, but it's something I'm pretty excited to start working on
